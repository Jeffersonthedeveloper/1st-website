  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>After not going to college I found myself looking for a purpose in life. I worked alot of service jobs and eventually landed in sales were I noticed I had a passion in helping people specifically in there business needs. It was the seed to what now is a passion in helping businesses with there tech needs.<br> <br>
  As I searched to how i was going to make this passion a skill I came across Thinkful and now have started my journey on becoming a software developer.  <br><br>
    If you are looking for a new developer who has the skill of being a independent teamplayer please reach out! I am so excited to work,learn and build with other great developers.
